If the switches are connected in a loop without STP, each switch would infinitely duplicate the first broadcast packet heard because there's nothing at Layer 2 to prevent a loop. In our case too, there is a loop in topology. When we started execution without STP, machine stopped responding because of large number of packets. So, we were not able to capture this on wireshark even after trying multiple times.
